A bit about Selendra and what we are set to accomplished for the networks and users. 

`Selendra` is a nominated proof-of-stake, multi-chains network system, together with its special purpose native parachains built for crypto's mass adoption.

`Selendra`'s special purpose native parachains consists of; 
- `Selendra DID`, a digital identity and credential network. 
- `Indracore EVM`, a fully EVM compatibility for cross-chain operations and DApps development with Solidity.
- `Rise Stable DAO`, a multi assets network of stablecoins design for Selendra ecosystem and cross-chain liquidity
- `Kumandra`, an effort to build fully decentralized computing and digital storages for decentralize era.

`SEL` is `Selendra`'s netive token. It is a multi-network token. It meants that SEL will be used to settle fee across these native parachains and apps that are built on them, make SEL a very desireable assets for utilities and an asset class to hold.
